It is often called a housecat when kept as an indoor pet,[6] or simply a cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship, and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.\r\n\r\nCats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.\r\n\r\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones, and types of cat-specific body language.[7]\r\n\r\nCats have a high breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, and the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.\r\n\r\nSource: wikipedia"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"published_date": "2014-11-08T11:20:52", "title": "Hedgehogs", "author": 2, "created_date": "2014-11-08T10:40:15", "text": "A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, which is in order Erinaceomorpha. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and New Zealand (by introduction). There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years.[2] Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal,[3] insectivorous way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent porcupines and monotreme echidnas.\r\n\r\nThe name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge (\"hedge\"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge (\"hog\"), from its piglike snout.[4] Other names include urchin, hedgepig and furze-pig.

The population continues to decline and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries.[1]\r\n\r\nThe red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs. It feeds mainly on bamboo, but is omnivorous and also eats eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.\r\n\r\nThe red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been previously placed in the raccoon and bear families, but results of phylogenetic research indicate strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family Ailuridae, which along with the weasel family is part of the superfamily Musteloidea.[4] Two subspecies are recognized.[3] It is not closely related to the giant panda.\r\n\r\nSource: wikipedia"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"published_date": null, "title": "Penguins", "author": 2, "created_date": "2014-11-08T10:41:43", "text": "Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.\r\n\r\nAlthough all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin, lives near the equator.\r\n\r\nThe largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.\r\n\r\nSource: wikipedia"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 9, "fields": {"published_date": null, "title": "Hedgehog's dilemma", "author": 1, "created_date": "2014-11-08T10:42:14", "text": "The hedgehog's dilemma, or sometimes the porcupine dilemma, is an analogy about the challenges of human intimacy. It describes a situation in which a group of hedgehogs all seek to become close to one another in order to share heat during cold weather. They must remain apart, however, as they cannot avoid hurting one another with their sharp spines. Though they all share the intention of a close reciprocal relationship, this may not occur, for reasons they cannot avoid.\r\n\r\nBoth Arthur Schopenhauer and Sigmund Freud have used this situation to describe what they feel is the state of individual in relation to others in society. The hedgehog's dilemma suggests that despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm, and what results is cautious behavior and weak relationships. With the hedgehog's dilemma, one is recommended to use moderation in affairs with others both because of self-interest, as well as out of consideration for others. The hedgehog's dilemma is used to explain introversion and isolationism.\r\n\r\nSource: wikipedia"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 1, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "4", "object_repr": "Gophers", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:39:01.207"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 2, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "3", "object_repr": "Miau", "action_flag": 3, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:39:09.763"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 3, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "2", "object_repr": "Sample title2", "action_flag": 3, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:39:09.902"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 4, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "1", "object_repr": "Sample title", "action_flag": 3, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:39:10.059"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 5, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "5", "object_repr": "Cats", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:40:08.966"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 6, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "6", "object_repr": "Hedgehogs", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:40:57.480"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 7, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "7", "object_repr": "Red pandas", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:41:26.333"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 8, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "8", "object_repr": "Penguins", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:41:51.008"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 9, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "", "object_id": "9", "object_repr": "Hedgehog's dilemma", "action_flag": 1, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:42:35.723"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 10, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "Changed text.", "object_id": "5", "object_repr": "Cats", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:42:47.584"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 11, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "Changed text.", "object_id": "6", "object_repr": "Hedgehogs", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:42:59.365"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 12, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "Changed text and published_date.", "object_id": "7", "object_repr": "Red pandas", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:14.110"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 13, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "Changed text.", "object_id": "8", "object_repr": "Penguins", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:22.607"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 14, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "No fields changed.", "object_id": "9", "object_repr": "Hedgehog's dilemma", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:29.109"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 15, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "Changed text.", "object_id": "4", "object_repr": "Gophers", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:35.061"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 16, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "No fields changed.", "object_id": "5", "object_repr": "Cats", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:40.295"}}, {"model": "admin.logentry", "pk": 17, "fields": {"content_type": 7, "change_message": "No fields changed.", "object_id": "6", "object_repr": "Hedgehogs", "action_flag": 2, "user": 2, "action_time": "2014-11-08T10:43:45.989"}}]
